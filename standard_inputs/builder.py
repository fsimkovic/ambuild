# Create two variables that hold the path to the .car files with the coordinates. A corresponding .csv file with

# the first argument. As everything in this run is in the builder directory, we can run the command:
# ./util.py step_1.pkl

# We now grow 5 new triquin fragments onto the amine blocks in the cell. We specify that the dihedral angle of the
# dihedral atoms (as specified in the two csv files) around the bond will be 0 degrees.
