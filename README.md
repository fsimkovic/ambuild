# Amorphous Builder (Ambuild)
Ambuild is a python program for creating polymeric molecular structures.

## Installation
### Ubuntu/Debian

* install git
```sudo apt-get install git```

#### Install Docker
Instructions from: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
```
# Remove any old versions:
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
# Set up docker repository:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
# Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# Set up stable repository
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
To allow users to run docker/ambuild without having sudo access, create docker group and add any users to it who will be required to run docker/ambuild.

```
# NB: may not be required
sudo groupadd docker
# Add user abbie
sudo usermod -aG docker
# Active group (to save logging out/in)
newgrp docker
# Test can run hello world
docker run hello-world
```

#### Install NVIDIA Docker Runtime
Instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

```
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image

```docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi```

Workaround for: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6691
```
# Seem to need this too:
sudo apt install nvidia-container-runtime
# Copy into /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    }
}
# Then:
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
**Disable video GPU.**
```
# Find ID of card to disable
nvidia-smi -L
# Disable video GPU by setting mode to 2/PROHIBITED
nvidia-smi -c 2 -i GPU-4030396e-e7b4-aa4d-e035-22758536dba5
```

### Checkout Ambuild
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/linucks/ambuild.git
```

#### Run Ambuild with Docker
To run Ambuild with docker a command like that below should be used.

> **NB: the backslash at the end of each line is a continuation character, so the whole block of text is actually a single command and could be typed as a single line.**

```
docker run -it --rm \
--runtime=nvidia \
--volume "$PWD":/home/glotzerlab \
--workdir /home/glotzerlab \
--volume /opt/ambuild/ambuild:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild \
--volume /opt/ambuild/tests/params:/home/glotzerlab/params \
glotzerlab/software \
python3 ambuild_script.py
```
Each line is explained below.

1. ```docker run -it --rm ``` Run docker in interactive mode and remove the container on exit.

2. ```--runtime=nvidia``` use the Nvidia environment to take advantage of the GPU acceleration.
3. ```--volume "$PWD":/home/glotzerlab``` Make the current working directory from where this command is run available inside the container as **/home/glotzerlab**/
4. ```--workdir /home/glotzerlab``` Make the working directory inside the container **/home/glotzerlab** - this means that the current working directory (** "$PWD"**) - will be used as the working directory for running Ambuild.
5. ```--volume /opt/ambuild/ambuild:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild``` Make the directory **/opt/ambuild/ambuild** on the local filesystem available as **/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild** within the container. This makes it possible for the python3 executable within the container to find the ambuild code, so that ```import ambuild``` within the ambuild_script.py works.
6. ```--volume /opt/ambuild/tests/params:/home/glotzerlab/params``` This is the only optional parameter - it makes the directory **/opt/ambuild/tests/params** available within the container as **/home/glotzerlab/params**, so that this directory will appear as **params** in the current working directory when the script is run. Any additional paths to directories outside the current working directory path will need to be added in this way.
7. ```glotzerlab/software``` Use the docker image from [glotzerlab/software](https://hub.docker.com/r/glotzerlab/software/). This downloads the file from the docker repository (it's very large - several Gb - so the download can take some time, although it's only done once), and uses this to create the container.
8. ```python3 ambuild_script.py``` Run the **ambuild_script.py** script, containing the Ambuild commands in the current directory with the python3 executable in the container.
