# Amorphous Builder (Ambuild)
Ambuild is a python program for creating polymeric molecular structures. 
Please feel free to follow Ambuild on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Ambuild2).

The code is developed by [Abbie Trewin's](https://twitter.com/AbbieTrewin) group at the [University of Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/people/abbie-trewin).

## Installation
In order to run at all, Ambuild requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), which is easily installed into any Python installation with a command such as ```pip install numpy```.

With numpy installed Ambuild can be used to create molecular structures, but cannot run any Molecular Dynamics or Optimisation steps. In order to do that, [HOOMD-Blue](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/) is required, and in order to run systems of a reasonable size, HOOMD-Blue will need to be running on GPUs. If you already have HOOMD-Blue installed you are ready to start using Ambuild, otherwise the instructions below detail how to install Ambuild and HOOMD-Blue.

### Ubuntu/Debian

* install git
```sudo apt-get install git```

#### Install Docker
Instructions from: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
```
# Remove any old versions:
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
# Set up docker repository:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
# Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# Set up stable repository
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
To allow users to run docker/ambuild without having sudo access, create docker group and add any users to it who will be required to run docker/ambuild.

```
# NB: may not be required
sudo groupadd docker
# Add user abbie
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Active group (to save logging out/in)
newgrp docker
# Test can run hello world
docker run hello-world
```

#### Install NVIDIA Docker Runtime
Instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

```
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image

```docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi```

Workaround for: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6691
```
# Seem to need this too:
sudo apt install nvidia-container-runtime
# Create a file called /etc/docker/daemon.json with the following command (copy and paste everything from "sudo" up to and including the "EOF" characters):
sudo tee -a /etc/docker/daemon.json << EOF
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    }
}
EOF
# Then:
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
**Disable video GPU.**
If you have more then one GPU card (e.g. you have card specifically for running jobs), the you may need to disable your video GPU card for running jobs so that any GPU jobs are placed on the specialised card rather then then using the video card. This will not disable the video card for viewing your screen - it will just prevent it being used to run computational simulation jobs.
```
# Find ID of card to disable (this will print the UUID string, that you can then use in the command below).
nvidia-smi -L
# Disable video GPU by setting mode to 2/PROHIBITED for the GPU card who's UUID we identified with the command above.
sudo nvidia-smi -c 2 -i GPU-4030396e-e7b4-aa4d-e035-22758536dba5
```

### Checkout Ambuild
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/linucks/ambuild.git
```

#### Run Ambuild with Docker
To run Ambuild with docker a command like that below should be used.

> **NB: the backslash at the end of each line is a continuation character, so the whole block of text is actually a single command and could be typed as a single line.**

The key thing to understand is that the Docker container cannot _see_ the local computer filesystem - it can only access the directory structure within the container. In order to access files on the local computer, any directories will need to be mounted into the container using ```--volume``` arguments, and then the _internal_ container path used within any scripts.

```
docker run --rm \
--runtime=nvidia \
--volume "$PWD":"$PWD" \
--workdir "$PWD" \
--volume /opt/ambuild/ambuild:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild \
--volume /home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild:/home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild \
glotzerlab/software \
python3 ambuild_script.py
```
Each line is explained below.

1. ```docker run --rm ``` run docker and remove the container on exit.

2. ```--runtime=nvidia``` use the Nvidia environment to take advantage of the GPU acceleration.
3. ```--volume "$PWD":"$PWD"``` make the current working directory from where this command is run (specified using the variable ```"$PWD"```) available inside the container.
4. ```--workdir $PWD``` make the working directory inside the container the full path to the working directory on the local machine. This means means that the current working directory where the script is run, will be used as the working directory for running Ambuild.
5. ```--volume /opt/ambuild/ambuild:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild``` make the directory ```/opt/ambuild/ambuild``` on the local filesystem available as ```/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ambuild``` within the container. This makes it possible for the python3 executable within the container to find the ambuild code, so that ```import ambuild``` within the ambuild_script.py works.
6. ```--volume /home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild:/home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild``` this is the only optional parameter. It makes the directory ```/home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild/params``` available within the container. Any additional paths to directories outside the current working directory that are used within the Ambuild script will need to be added in this way.
7. ```glotzerlab/software``` use the docker image from [glotzerlab/software](https://hub.docker.com/r/glotzerlab/software/). This downloads the file from the Docker repository (it's very large - several Gb - so the download can take some time, although it's only done once), and uses this to create the container.
8. ```python3 ambuild_script.py``` run the ```ambuild_script.py``` script, containing the Ambuild commands in the current directory with the python3 executable in the container.

#### Run Ambuild with Docker using the run_ambuild_docker.sh script
The file [run_ambuild_docker.sh](https://github.com/linucks/ambuild/blob/master/misc/run_ambuild_docker.sh) that is distributed with Ambuild in the ```misc``` directory faciliates running Ambuild with an installed Docker installation. It creates the command to run the Docker container, and accepts additional ```--volume``` arguments, as well as the path to the ambuild script to run. An example of using it is below, where Ambuild has been downloaded and unpacked into the ```/opt/``` directory, and the files in the ```/home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild_Files``` directory need to be accessed within the ```cell_size_test.py``` Ambuild script:
```
/opt/ambuild/misc/run_ambuild_docker.sh \
--volume /home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild_Files:/home/abbie/Dropbox/Ambuild_Files \
cell_size_test.py
```
## Installation of optional dependencies
### Poreblazer
To install [poreblazer](https://github.com/richardjgowers/poreblazer) for use by Ambuild, the following steps are required.

1. Checkout or download poreblazer from github:
```git clone https://github.com/richardjgowers/poreblazer.git```

2. Install the [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) compiler. On Ubuntu/Debian, this should just be a case of running:
```sudo apt-get install gfortran```

3. Compile the poreblazer executable. This is done in the ```src``` directory of the poreblazer directory, so cd into this directory and then run the command:```make``` This should created the ```poreblazer.exe``` executable in this directory.
